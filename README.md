## Installation
While you can see the code and build an executable with `go build .`, the best way to install an IdleReader is to head to the release page and download the pre-built `.exe` at:

`placeholder-link.com`

To play the game, simply double click on the .exe that you have just installed.

## Closing Thoughts & How To Contribute
Thank you for checking out my text-based idle game, IdleReader!

Since it is my first full game that I have decided to release, please let me know what I could improve on, game ideas, and if any books that you loved and and that I have missed. I'd be more than happy to add it to the game :)
