# IdleReader: A Text-based Journey ðŸ“šðŸ“–
Welcome to Idle Reader! Immerse yourself in this idle text-based game! Accumulate knowledge, grow your intelligence to purchase real in-game books. 
<br>
To play the game, head to the  <a href="#[ðŸ“• Installation](https://github.com/Soapalin/IdleReader/blob/master/README.md#-installation)">installation</a> section down below or to the <a href="https://github.com/Soapalin/IdleReader/releases">release</a> page.

## ðŸ“• Description 

Start your journey with only your favourite book in-hand! By reading it, grow your Intelligence and Knowledge. Knowledge is the currency used in-game: use it wisely to purchase and collect your favourite books! Beware, some books have Intelligence requirements, and the only way to grow your IQ is to read different books (at least once).

## ðŸ“• Installation
For a stress-free installation, head to release page and download the latest version of the game. Only the executable `IdleReader` file is required to run the game. A version is available for each OS (Windows, Linux, MacOS).

To play the game, simply double click on the file that you have just downloaded.

Note for Windows users: For best experience, install `Windows Terminal` (default as of Windows 11 22H2!). See in-depth guide <a href="">here</a>. You can still play the game without `Windows Terminal` but the default rendering will be a bit off (such as not having emojis available).


For advanced users, you can build your own binaries of the game:
- Clone the repository: `git clone [repository]`
- Navigate to the repo and build the binaries with `go build .`
- the binaries built should be called `engine`
